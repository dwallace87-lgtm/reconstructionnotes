    <blockquote>
      “We ask to the questions the attention of all considerate men, who view the
      admission to the Union, of Texas, as Texas now is, as an evil. We may not,
      we ought not to leave Texas as it is. We ought, by acting in Texas, by our
      emigrants in Texas, by our moral influence in Texas, by our votes in Texas,
      to continue there the contest of freedom, in the first skirmish of which we
      have been defeated. We ought thus to prevent the four last evils which have
      been named. We ought to hasten the end of slavery in South Eastern Texas,
      and make Northern and Western Texas free. We ought to restore the balance
      of power, between the free and slave States.”
